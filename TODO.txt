data_gen
--------

- update source files to include April 21st flight data
- segment data to 'complex' and 'plain' wfs (under/over 15ns)
- fix / remove null values from .h5 files

nnet
----

- setup (mini)batches (i.e., call get_data() per epoch)
- optimize parameters (Spearmint)
- implement save restore (so model is portable)
- include 2D spatial dropout
- include (de)ception for backing out of inception module

1-automate building the neural net
	a-number of layers, 
	b-decide which parameters to use: 
		i. 	number of kernels and dimensions (d,1), 
		ii. 	activation functions,
		iii. 	weight regularizers, 
		iv. 	weights initialization.

2-Change binary cross entropy to MSE

3-Write report baseline:
	a-description of 
		i.	generation of data 
		ii. 	de-noising convolution neural net auto-encoder
		iii. 	manual/ grid search 
	b-run and get result (baseline for hyperparameter tunning -1st goal)
